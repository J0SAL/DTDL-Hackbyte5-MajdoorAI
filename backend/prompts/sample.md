Here is the detailed plan for the user's idea:\n\n**Readme.md**\n\n**1. Features**\n\n* **Base Features:**\n\t+ Users can search for social activities (e.g., hiking, book clubs, sports teams) near their location.\n\t+ Users can filter activities by interests, location, and date.\n* **Standout Features:**\n\t+ Users can create and manage their own social groups, inviting friends and like-minded individuals to join.\n\t+ Users can rate and review social activities, providing feedback to the community.\n\n**2. Project Timeline**\n\n| Phase | Milestones | Deadlines |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Planning | Define project scope, Identify target audience, Determine features and requirements | 1 week |\n| Design | Create wireframes, Design UI/UX, Develop branding and visual identity | 2 weeks |\n| Development | Develop core features, Implement search functionality, Integrate map API | 8 weeks |\n| Testing | Conduct unit testing, Conduct UI/UX testing, Conduct integration testing | 4 weeks |\n| Deployment | Deploy to app stores, Conduct beta testing, Release to the public | 4 weeks |\n\n**3. Cost Considerations**\n\n**Budget Estimation:** ₹1,500,000 - ₹2,000,000\n\n**Resource Allocation:**\n\n* 2 Developers (₹300,000 each)\n* 1 Designer (₹200,000)\n* 1 Tester (₹150,000)\n* Project Manager (₹250,000)\n\n**Cost Breakdown:**\n\n* Personnel: ₹1,100,000 (73%)\n* Software Tools: ₹150,000 (10%)\n* Hardware: ₹50,000 (3%)\n* Miscellaneous: ₹100,000 (7%)\n\n**4. Task Management**\n\n**Task List:**\n\nPlanning:\n\n* Define project scope\n* Identify target audience\n* Determine features and requirements\n\nDesign:\n\n* Create wireframes\n* Design UI/UX\n* Develop branding and visual identity\n\nDevelopment:\n\n* Develop core features\n* Implement search functionality\n* Integrate map API\n\nTesting:\n\n* Conduct unit testing\n* Conduct UI/UX testing\n* Conduct integration testing\n\nDeployment:\n\n* Deploy to app stores\n* Conduct beta testing\n* Release to the public\n\n**Prioritization:**\n\n* Define project scope (high)\n* Develop core features (high)\n* Conduct unit testing (high)\n* Deploy to app stores (high)\n\n**Dependencies:**\n\n* Develop core features → Implement search functionality\n* Implement search functionality → Integrate map API\n* Conduct unit testing → Conduct UI/UX testing\n\n**5. Resource Planning**\n\n**Team Structure:**\n\n* Project Manager\n* 2 Developers\n* 1 Designer\n* 1 Tester\n\n**Hiring Plan:**\n\n* Hire 1 additional Developer if needed\n\n**Training Requirements:**\n\n* Training on map API integration\n* Training on UI/UX design principles\n\n**6. Risk Management**\n\n**Risk Identification:**\n\n* Technical risks: Integrating map API, Developing search functionality\n* Project risks: Scope creep, Team member turnover\n\n**Mitigation Strategies:**\n\n* Break down complex tasks into smaller ones\n* Conduct regular team meetings and progress tracking\n* Identify and prioritize tasks with high risks\n\n**Contingency Plans:**\n\n* Identify alternative map API providers\n* Develop a backup plan for scope creep\n\n**7. Tools and Technologies**\n\n**Recommended Tools:**\n\n* Trello or Asana for project management\n* Figma or Sketch for UI/UX design\n* React Native or Flutter for development\n* JIRA or TestRail for testing\n* Google Maps API for map integration\n\n**Integration Suggestions:**\n\n* Integrate Trello or Asana with development tools for seamless workflow\n* Use Figma or Sketch plugins for automatic design updates\n* Integrate React Native or Flutter with Google Maps API for map integration
